# Operation Christmas
Just the final project for CSC405: Algorithms & Software. My group and I wanted to make a survival game as our experience in Processing would work well in that particular area. Here's the rough, but final end result. It's a game, controlled by your keyboard and mouse, where the player (playing as Santa) battles continuous waves of grinches that have increasing numbers and speed. Hope you enjoy!

# Getting Started
You would need Processing 3.5.3 or higher, although older versions should usually work.

First, download all the files in the repository. Then, create a new project in Processing and drag all the .pde files into the project folder, or the Processing window itself. As for the data files, you can either drag the data folder directly into the project folder or simply drag all the files into the Processing window, which should automatically create a data folder in the project and insert the files into it.
